        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ava McDonald, a passionate digital media student with a strong aspiration to develop games. Ever since I can remember, I've been captivated by art and storytelling. I’ve always loved creating. Whether it was sketching characters, painting on a canvas, or exploring digital design. My passion for art naturally evolved into an interest in game development, where I can blend creativity with technology to build immersive worlds and engaging experiences.
        Through my studies, I’m honing my skills in digital media, learning everything from design principles to interactive storytelling. My goal is to create games that not only entertain but also inspire and connect with audiences on a deeper level. I’m excited to continue developing my skills, collaborating with other creative minds, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what games can achieve.</p>
